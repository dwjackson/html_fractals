HTML Fractals
=============

This is just a hobby project for drawing fractals using the HTML5 canvas
element. At the moment, most of the fractals are drawn by describing them
using L-Systems. There are some pre-defined L-Systems built into the system.
Other fractals are in their own folders.

Pre-Defined L-Sytems
--------------------

The L-Systems that this collection currently has in it are:

- Barnsley Fern
- Dragon Curve
- Sierpinsky Triangle
- Plant (it looks a bit like a grass-y weed)
