HTML Fractals
=============

This is just a hobby project for drawing fractals using the HTML5 canvas
element. At the moment, most of the fractals are drawn by describing them
using L-Systems. There are some pre-defined L-Systems built into the system.
Other fractals are in their own folders.

--------------
