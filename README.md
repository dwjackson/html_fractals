HTML Fractals
=============

This is just a hobby project for drawing fractals using the HTML5 canvas
element. Each individual page should be fairly self-explanatory.

Fractal Types
-------------

The fractal types that this collection currently has in it are:

- Barnsley Fern
- Dragon Curve
- Sierpinsky Triangle
- Plant (it looks a bit like a grass-y weed)
