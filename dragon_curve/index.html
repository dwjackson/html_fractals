    <h1>Dragon Curve</h1>
    <p>This page draws dragon curves. That should be fairly obvious based on
    the header. You can define the number of iterations for the curve below.
    Also, you can save the curve as an image if you want to. Just right click
    and save it like you would any other image.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The more iterations you do, the longer the
    dragon curve will take to generate. For example, just 11 iterations takes
    several second to generate. You <em>really</em> don't want to go more than
    12 iterations, by the way, or you'll be here <em>a while</em>.</p>
    <p>
